#### How can I know I’m ready? What are the minimum requirements to join?

You’ll need, at minimum, basic HTML / CSS and Javascript skills to qualify for a Chingu Voyage. Know more than that? Chingu has got you covered: our Voyages have three different “tiers” separated by skill level (beginners, intermediate, advanced) so you can work in the Tier you are most comfortable in. We also run a Pre-work session once a month where members can discover what Tier they best fit in.

TL;DR - We encourage people at any level (including beginners) to join, as our Pre-work program was designed to inspire / help people gain the skills they need to be eligible to join.

#### Can I do many Chingu Voyage programs and level up my skills in each one?

Yes, Chingu was designed for this. Companies want to hire experienced developers. If you successfully completed 4 Voyages, you’d have a robust portfolio, technical / soft skills, and 6 months of developer experience to apply to jobs with.

#### Can I get a job from doing Chingu Voyages?

Yes, every week we see members getting a job. Members who have successfully completed 3 Voyages at the tier-3 level generally are job ready. They have gained the skills necessary to build multiple full-stack applications, have at least 4.5 months of experience working on real projects in real teams, and understand the importance of soft skills.

#### I just finished a coding bootcamp and want to get more experience? Is Chingu for me?

Yes. Coding bootcamp instructors / career mentors from many of the major bootcamps have referred their graduates to Chingu to help them get a job.

#### How can I know if I’m ready for the Voyage program?

First, are you committed to your learning goals? A Chingu Voyage is an experience that will get you out of your comfort zone and accelerate your learning. If you aren’t committed, you’ll waste your time and your team-mates.

As for skill level, every new member has to complete a Pre-work project to be accepted to ensure they are ready. We run a 2 week pre-work session every month so you you find out if you are ready now. If not, you will be pushed to level-up your skills in the Pre-work to be ready for the next one. :)

#### What happens if I don’t finish the Pre-work project or pass the qualifications?

No worries, we run Voyages every month so if you don’t pass the Pre-work you can keep learning and be ready for the next one.

#### How much time do I have to commit?

We organize teams based on the people who join, and you’ll be matched with people who have similar commitment levels to you. That being said, we consider part-time to be around 15 hours a week and full-time to be 25 or more hours a week.

For you to get the full benefits, Chingu must be a priority during the duration of the Voyage program.

#### Is the Voyage okay for Beginners?

Yes. Even if you are not ready now, you will be after you gain the skills necessary to build the Pre-work project.

#### What is the Pre-work session and Pre-work project?

The Pre-work session is where new members first join the Chingu community, find out which Tier they best fit in, and build a project from start to finish to ensure they are ready for the team Voyage project. The Pre-work projects are organized by Tier and typically to clone an existing website or app. When you join the Pre-work you’ll be able to decide which project (and tier) best suits your current skill level.

#### What if I have more questions?
