# Chingu Dashboard (backend)

## Tech Choices

I have chosen to use Node.js and mongoDB for the api as I have used them in the past, it is my first time making an API with authenticaion for the login as my pervious projects did not require it. 

## Build Setup

```
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# Postman 
I used postman for testing the server, this can be found at: https://www.postman.com/

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

```

## **.env** file

DB_CONNECT = mongodb+srv://Snow:<password>@cluster0-scly5.mongodb.net/test?retryWrites=true&w=majority
TOKEN_SECRET = ajsodhosaidj
