# Chingu Dashboard (backend)

## Tech Choices

I have chosen to use Node.js and mongoDB for the api as I have used them in the past, it is my first time making an API with authenticaion for the login as my pervious projects did not require it.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install


# production
$ npm run start

# development
$ npm run dev

```

## **.env** file

```
DB_CONNECT = DB_URL_HERE
TOKEN_SECRET = TOKEN_STRING_HERE
```

> I used [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) for testing the server
